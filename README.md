## DE-solving-methods
Numerical methods for solving DE implemented by me during the course on models and methods of analysis of design solutions

### Finite element method

One dimentional ODE was solved by finite elemet method with difference number of grid points. The results were analyzed.

### Advanced nodal method for mechanical systems
